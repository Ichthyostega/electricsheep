Here's a script you can have electricsheep run as the player:

#!/bin/bash
mplayer -fps $2 -wid $4 - <&0

It would be better to parse the arguments electricsheep passes but oh well.
It's neat seeing the sheep in full screen.

Here's something even cooler though. Replace the -wid $4 with -rootwin, and
then run electricsheep. Mplayer will draw the sheep on your desktop, underneath
all of your windows! If you're running KDE, you'll have to run "kdekillall
kdesktop" to see the effect, and I imagine something similar goes for Gnome and
other desktops. If my video card didn't flicker video so much when moving
windows, I'd be using this as my desktop right now.
